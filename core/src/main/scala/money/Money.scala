    * if the conversion rate from, say, EUR to USD is 1.13 it's not guaranteed that the one from USD to EUR is exactly
    * 1 / 1.13 (i.e. the inverse). For this reason, for example, you could have:
    * ```
    * 100(EUR).compare(113(USD)) > 0 == true // (1)
    * // but
    * 113(USD).compare(100(EUR)) < 0 == false // (2)
    * ```
    *
    * This is because `that` is first converted to `this` currency and then the resulting
    * amounts are compared. The rule is as simple as the outer left currency is the base one into which all other
    * currencies are converted within an expression.
    * In the previous example (1) 113 USD is converted to EUR and then compared to 100 EUR.
    * In example (2) it's 100 EUR that is converted to USD and then compared. Since the conversion rates are not one
    * the inverse of the other you get apparently inconsistent results even if, for the provided conversions, they
    * are consistent.
    *

    * @return an `Int` that is:
    *         <ul>
